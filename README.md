# project-bankist-app

Hi! This project was created as part of learning JavaScript Numbers, Dates, Intl, and timers in the Udemy course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. I wrote the codes while following his lectures and demos.

To try the app, you may open it using this link:

Login using the demo account:

username: js

password: 1111

You can try actions such as:
1) transfer credits to another demo account (username "jd")
2) request loan
3) close an account
